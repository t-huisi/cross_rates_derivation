# cross_rates_derivation

Current use case (mostly its against USD) -> e.g. 1 CHF = 1.123123 USD 

User will have to input the first currency pair and second currency pair. 

e.g:
first currency pair of 1.123123 USD = 1 CHF 
second currency pair of 1.0615 USD = 1 EUR 

The code will allow user to derive how much 1 CHF is against EUR e.g. 1 CHF = 0.903123123 EUR and 1 EUR = 1.12312312 CHF
